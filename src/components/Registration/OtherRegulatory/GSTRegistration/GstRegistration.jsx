            Why Consider GST Registration Even If Itâ€™s Not Applicable?

            The <strong>GST law</strong> exempts businesses from registration until they cross the

            legally required. The reason is simple â€” <strong>GST registration</strong> offers much more than
            compliance. It provides <strong>strategic</strong>, <strong>financial</strong>, and{" "}

            Introduction
          </Typography>
          <Typography sx={{ mb: 2 }}>
            Goods and Services Tax (GST) is one of the most significant tax reforms in India. Introduced in July
            2017, GST replaced multiple indirect taxes like VAT, Service Tax, and Excise Duty with a single unified
            system. It simplified taxation and created a transparent business environment.
          </Typography>
          <Typography sx={{ mb: 4 }}>
            Every business that crosses the prescribed turnover threshold or engages in specific taxable activities
            must obtain GST Registration. At <strong>Rekotax</strong>, we provide end-to-end support for GST
            registration and compliance, ensuring your business remains tax-ready, compliant, and hassle-free.

            What is GST Registration?
          </Typography>
          <Typography sx={{ mb: 4 }}>
            GST Registration is the process of enrolling a business under the GST law to obtain a unique{" "}
            <strong>15-digit GST Identification Number (GSTIN)</strong>. This number enables businesses to collect
            GST from customers, file tax returns, and claim input tax credit on purchases. Without GST registration,
            businesses cannot legally collect tax or avail credit on the GST paid to suppliers.

          <Typography sx={{ mb: 2 }}>
            GST registration is mandatory for certain categories of businesses and professionals. Below are the key
            groups that require GST registration:
          </Typography>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Businesses with turnover above the prescribed threshold:</strong> Any business that crosses the
              annual turnover limit set by GST law must obtain registration to comply with tax regulations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Inter-state suppliers of goods and services:</strong> Businesses involved in selling goods or
              services across state boundaries are required to register under GST regardless of turnover.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>E-commerce operators and aggregators:</strong> Online platforms facilitating the sale of goods
              or services are compulsorily required to obtain GST registration.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Casual taxable persons:</strong> Businesses that occasionally supply goods or services in
              another state where they do not have a fixed place of business must register under GST.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Non-resident taxable persons:</strong> Foreign businesses providing goods or services in India
              without a permanent establishment must register under GST.

              <strong>Businesses required to deduct or collect TDS/TCS:</strong> Specific entities like government
              departments or e-commerce operators that deduct/collect tax at source must be registered under GST.

          </ul>

          {/* Threshold Limits */}

            GST Threshold Limits (2025)
          </Typography>
          <Typography sx={{ mb: 2 }}>
            GST law prescribes turnover limits for mandatory registration. These limits ensure that small businesses
            are relieved from heavy compliance. The threshold limits are:
          </Typography>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>â‚¹40 lakhs for goods suppliers:</strong> Businesses engaged in supplying goods with turnover above
              â‚¹40 lakhs must register (â‚¹20 lakhs in special category states).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>â‚¹20 lakhs for service providers:</strong> Businesses offering services must register if turnover
              exceeds â‚¹20 lakhs (â‚¹10 lakhs in special category states).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <Typography sx={{ mb: 4 }}>
            Voluntary registration is also available for businesses below the threshold. Opting for it offers benefits
